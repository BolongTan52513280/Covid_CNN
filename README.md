# Covid_CNN
The rapid spread of the Covid 19 has a great impact on the lungs of patients. This project aims to 
use the convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify and detect Pneumonia to help doctors 
diagnose Pneumonia. In this project, CNN overall structure, dropout value, and learning rate to 
train the model are adjusted to improve CNN model’s performance. CNN model’s performance 
is evalueted based on its loss, accuracy and F1 score

The dataset used in this project is downloaded from Kaggle and uploaded to the personal google 
drive. The dataset can be download from the link:

ink. (Please download the dataset and change the file path accordingly before running the code. 
Due to the high computation requirement, the Colab pro version may be needed.)
